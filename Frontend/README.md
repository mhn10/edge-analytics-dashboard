# FrontEnd

## React

Most of the components are written using React functional Components and leverages the context API and react hooks to manage states between components. We haven't used Redux as we never felt the need for it. Context API was more efficient and pure in our case. Hooks have been used, mainly the useState and useEffect hooks.

### Structure
The app has been structured in a way to take advantage of the context api. We use main pages like Add new task, Deploy new task and Dashboard

### Styling
Styling has been done through [styled components](https://www.styled-components.com).
